# CS6500 - Assignment 2 
# KDC based key  establishment
The objective of this assignment is to implement the KDC-based key establishment (exchange) for use
with symmetric key encryption algorithms.
The data encryption algorithm to be used for client-client and KDC-client communication is: AES-128-
CBC, i.e. 128-bit key with CBC mode.
